We are glad to inform about the latest innovations that are to be occurring in the nearest future so today, a project by google which is code named as "Project soli".

Google is now in the middle of developing a new interaction design sensor using radar technology that can track movement with a lot of accuracy.

It's only the size of a small computer chip and can be inserted into everyday objects and the things we daily use.

Ivan poupyrev says," the hand is alternate input device, extremely precise,its extremely fast, it's very natural for us to use it,capturing the possibilities of human hand was one of my passions".

The fineness of human actions and fineness of using our hand is appropriate functionality that has to be carried out with the help of chip.

The chip emits the radar frequency above the surface area of the device which indeed traces the movements of the fingers resulting with fulfillment of user operations.

The team behind google's Project Ara and Project Tango said the interactions among smartwatches and other wearable could be transformed.

&nbsp;

Project Soli is a small, gesture-recognizing, radar-enabled sensor that aims to provide a way for people to interact with their smartwatches without touching their displays. The experimental project was introduced by ATAP, Google's Advanced technology and Projects group, during a session at the company's I/O developer conference Friday.

&nbsp;

The major applications of the chip would be like that tracks the cars,big objects,satellites, and planes. Even the chip is capable of tracking the micro motions, twitches of the human hand. Which can be used in interacting with other computing devices available  and or  on the Internet.

&nbsp;

Jaime Lien,Lead research engineer at Project Soli,said - our team is focused on taking radar hardware and turning it into gesture sensor. Radar is the technology which transmits a radio wave towards a target and then the receiver of the radar intercepts the reflected energy from that target. The various stages of this pipeline are designed to extract specific gestures information from that one radar signal that we receive at a high frame rate."

&nbsp;

We know that radars are having very high positional accuracy,which means that we can sense the tiniest motions
The actual demonstration of Project soli.
