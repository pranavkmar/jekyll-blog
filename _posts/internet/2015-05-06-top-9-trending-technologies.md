<h1><strong>Platform as a Service</strong></h1>
<b>Platform as a service</b> (<b>PaaS</b>) is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run and manage Web applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.

PaaS is a huge trend in app development right now, with every big tech vendor, every hosting company, and every maker of app development tools looking for game in the PaaS market.

Estimated paygrade:        <strong>$130,081</strong>
<h1><strong>Cassandra <img class="alignright" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Cassandra_logo.svg/279px-Cassandra_logo.svg.png" alt="" width="195" height="131" /></strong></h1>
<b>Apache Cassandra</b> is an open source distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers robust support for clusters spanning multiple datacenters, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients.

Cassandra also places a high value on performance. In 2012, University of Toronto researchers studying <em>NoSQL</em> systems concluded that "In terms of scalability, there is a clear winner throughout our experiments. Cassandra achieves the highest throughput for the maximum number of nodes in all experiments" although "this comes at the price of high write and read latencies."

<h1><strong>MapReduce    <img class="alignright" src="https://surfsara.nl/sites/default/files/field/image/Hadoop_logo_0.jpg" alt="" width="162" height="121" />
</strong></h1>
MapReduce has been called "the heart of Hadoop."

MapReduce is the method that allows Hadoop to store all kinds of data across many low-cost computer servers. To get meaningful data of Hadoop, a programmer writes software programs (often in the popular language, Java) for MapReduce.
Pay for MapReduce-associated jobs has climbed 11% over last year, Dice says. It has over 500 job listings for it.

Estimated paygrade:      <strong>$127,315</strong>
<h1><strong>Cloudera   <img class=" alignright" src="http://data-informed.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Cloudera-logo-300x94.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="63" />
</strong></h1>
Cloudera is a company that makes a commercial version of Hadoop.

Cloudera Inc. is an American-based software company that provides Apache Hadoop-based software, support and services, and training to business customers.
Although Hadoop is a free and open-source-project for storing large amounts of data on inexpensive computer servers, the free version of Hadoop is not easy to use. Several companies have created friendlier versions of Hadoop, and Cloudera is arguably the most popular one.
Pay for Cloudera-associated jobs has climbed 20% over the last year,experts says.

<h1><strong>Hbase<img class="alignright" src="http://hbase.apache.org/images/hbase_logo.png" alt="" width="247" height="61" /></strong></h1>
Hbase is yet another project based on the popular Hadoop technology.

Hadoop is a way to store all kinds of data across many low-cost computer servers. Once that data is stored using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hbase can sort through that data and group bits of data together, somewhat similar to how a traditional database organizes data.

Pay for Hbase-associated jobs has climbed 20% over last year. It has over 660 job listings for it.

<h1><strong>Pig<img class=" alignright" src="http://www.bigsql.org/se/images/pig.png" alt="" width="144" height="144" /></strong></h1>
Pig is another hot skill, thanks to demand for technologies like Big Data and Hadoop.

Pig is a programming language that helps extract information from Hadoop like find answers to certain questions or otherwise use the data.

Pay for Pig-associated jobs climbed 13% over the last year

<strong>Estimated paygrade:     $124,563</strong>

<h1><strong>ABAP <img class="alignright" src="http://www.gokhaneksi.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/abap1.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="62" />
</strong></h1>
Advanced Business Application Programming or ABAP is the software language developed by SAP for building business applications on top of its business application suite.

Businesses often want to write custom apps that make use of the data stored in SAP. Developers also write commercial apps for SAP.

Pay for ABAP-associated jobs jumped by 24% over the last year.

<h1><strong>Chef <img class="alignright" src="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-37-45/5047.OC_5F00_Chef_5F00_Logo.png" alt="" width="115" height="91" />
</strong></h1>
Chef is "IT automation" software from Chef Software, one of a handful of young companies ushering in a huge new tech trend called "DevOps."

DevOps is when the developers building applications ("dev") and IT people deploying them (operations or "ops") work together to use speedy techniques so they can deploy technology as fast as it's released. Chef helps IT professionals automate tasks that keep computer servers running efficiently.

<h1><strong>Flume<img class=" alignright" src="https://flume.apache.org/_static/flume-logo.png" alt="" width="143" height="143" /></strong></h1>
<strong>Flume is yet another skill spawned from Big data" craze and the popularity of Hadoop.</strong>

Hadoop is a way to store all kinds of data across many low-cost computer servers. Flume is a method to move massive amounts of data from the place it was created into a Hadoop system.
Dice has over 150 job listings for Flume-related jobs

Estimated paygrade:    $<strong>123,186</strong>
