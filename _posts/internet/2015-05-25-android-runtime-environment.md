Today’s article is about  creating and running the android applications <strong> </strong>for any windows,linux or mac operating systems. Bluestacks app player is the one of the Best Android Emulator for PC to run android apps in free of cost and also most flexible to play android games on pc . But you must need a pc with high configuration minimum atleast 2 GB Ram, Dual Core Processer and updated graphic drivers to run bluestacks smoothly on your system. If not you will get errors like graphic card error 25000 etc during installation. You can also run bluestacks on your low configuration pc by installing older version of bluestacks.But its not recommended because it won't support all android application and games.

Bluestacks have become popular as it evolved with the google play services
But now the days are gone,there are plugins that support google chrome to have a run time environment for Android.
