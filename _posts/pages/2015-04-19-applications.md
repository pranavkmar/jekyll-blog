The Android M developer preview was launched today at Google I/O 2015 in San Francisco.At the same time,senior vice president of products at Google,Sundar Pichai says the company has "gone back to the basics" and improved quality of the platform. Where Android 5.0 Lollipop introduced a new design and interface, M appears to be focused on improving the stability and usability of the software. Google haven't confirmed the version number or name of M will be just yet, but it is showing of a lot of what will be part of the update.

"The company has been watching what device makers have been adding to Android and is folding a lot of those ideas into the core system" says Dave Burke, vice president of engineering at Google.

Android M is majorly focused on six new areas, ranging from new features to improved performance and efficiency.

&nbsp;
<h1>App Permissions</h1>

<h1></h1>
Now users being able to choose to accept or deny individual permissions as they see fit. Permissions privileges have been simplified.

Mr.Burke said,"You don't have to agree to permissions that don't make sense to you,"concluding that permissions will now be requested the first time you try to use a feature, not at the point of installation

Android M is offering users a greater control of the information that apps can access, and this is a truly positive step forward for Android.

You can modify the permissions granted to apps at a later date in your Settings, or you can view permissions by type and see which apps have that permission granted. It's all about giving the user complete control over their Android.
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Web Experience</h2>
The Android M is now enhanced with all new features to provide a better user-experience when interacting with websites and apps. "Chrome Custom Tabs is a new feature that gives developers a way to harness all of Chrome's capabilities, while still keeping control of the look and feel of the experience," said Burke.
<h2>Mobile payments</h2>
Google's response to Apple pay is here. Android Pay is Google's new mobile payments system designed to make the checkout process easier and faster. Google is aiming to provide "simplicity, security, and choice," with Android Pay, allowing you to use your existing credit cards to pay for products in more than 700,000 stores in the US. Compatible with any device housing NFC capabilities, the Android Pay platform is being supported by American Express, Visa, Mastercard, and Discover, as well as carriers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-295" src="{{ site.url }}/uploads/2015/05/paymnts.jpg" alt="paymnts" width="781" height="398" />
<h2>Power and charging</h2>
To improve the standby time ,Android M makes use of a new function known as Doze. By using motion detectors, Android will recognize when devices haven’t been interacted with for a while, such as when a person is asleep or a device has been left on a table, to reduce background processes. Burke said that Google tested two Nexus 9 devices, one running Lollipop and one running the Android M preview, and learned that M will provide up to two-times longer standby time. Even in Doze mode, your Android can still start alarms or notify you of priority notifications. Android M also supports USB Type-C which provides faster charging, and lets users charge other devices with their phone. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-296" src="{{ site.url }}/uploads/2015/05/google-io-battery-w782.png" alt="google-io-battery-w782" width="782" height="440" />
