<div class="blueText"><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></div>
<div>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a</div>
<div>privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the</div>
<div> United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable</div>
<div> information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly</div>
<div>the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to</div>
<div> comply with this policy. - See more at:</div>
<div><a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></div>
<div><strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong></div>
<div>Users can visit our site anonymously</div>
<div>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first</div>
<div>significant page after entering our website.</div>
<div>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</div>
<div>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</div>
<div>      <strong>•</strong> On our Privacy Policy Page</div>
<div>Users are able to change their personal information:</div>

<div><strong>How does our site handle do not track signals?</strong></div>
<div>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT)</div>

<div class="blueText"><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></div>
<div>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online</div>
<div> Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's</div>
<div> consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and</div>
<div> online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</div>
<div>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</div>
&nbsp;
<div class="blueText"><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></div>
<div>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the</div>
<div>concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the</div>
<div> globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical</div>
<div> to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, </strong></div>
<div><strong>should a data breach occur:</strong></div>
<div>We will notify the users via email</div>
<div>      <strong>•</strong> Within 7 business days</div>
<div>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally</div>
<div> enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle</div>
<div> requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have</div>
<div> recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</div>
&nbsp;
<div class="blueText"><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></div>
<div>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for</div>
<div> commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells</div>
<div> out tough penalties for violations.</div>
<div><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></div>
